### Enable VSCode syntax highlighting

<sub>**Disclaimer**: The instructions given below are tested and working on Linux</sub>

```

Now complete the `yo code` as we suggest in the picture below:

Finally copy the folder `grace_vscode_syntax_highlighting` and paste it inside folder `~/.vscode/extensions`. Additionally you may want to remove/delete any unnecessary files that were created at this process.


<sub>**Hint**: Consider creating a soft link to point to the folder of this repository, in order to update the syntax highlighter easier by pulling any changes from github</sub>
