$$
    This program fails because it attempts
    an addition between a char variable and
    an integer. It should fail due to some
    type error. We do not think it should
    trigger the same error as paramexprtype2.
$$
fun paramexprtype3 () : nothing
   fun test(a, b, c: int) : int
   {
      return a + b + c;
   }
   var a, b, c, d: int;
{
   d <- test(test(a, b, c), a + b + c, 'c' + 5);
}
